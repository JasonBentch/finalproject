3/25 VERSION

Bugs:
It's possible to confuse the mutes and solos so that everything is playing while one track is soloed. The addition of visual feedback with styling would help.
There is a small gap when the audio loops, but it still stays in sync.
Pause could function more as a play/pause toggle instead of just a temporary stop button.


To do list:
3/25/18

now possible to add panning functionality
add advanced effect functionality (if possible)
Add database (incomplete)
style it up
